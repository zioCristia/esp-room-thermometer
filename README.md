Esp8266-01 based module, 220V ac powered, for measuring room temperature for your domotic house

I built this module to have an inexpensive and reliable sensor in every room of my house. 
Total cost per sensor is around 5.5â‚¬ and includes all components and pcb. It does not rely on batteries but on an ac-dc transformer type HLK-PM03. 
The design is intended to minimize the dimensions and thus be able to put the sensor inside the power boxes, where there are light switches to be clear. I 3D printed a container to be able to easily insert it in the boxes type btcino and allow the sensor to effectively detect the temperature and humidity outside through some openings.

The software used is EspHome in order to integrate the sensors with my HomeAssistant server but you may well use another software to your liking.
